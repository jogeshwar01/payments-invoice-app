Mid-Level Engineer · Backend Hiring
At a Glance
Time budget 4 to 6 hours of focused work. Stop and document remaining work if

you exceed.

Language Rust strongly preferred (Axum, Actix, or Warp). Other languages

allowed with a brief justification in the README.

Database PostgreSQL with migrations.
Setup docker compose up runs the app, database, and mock PSP with no

manual steps.

AI tools Allowed. Disclosure of usage is mandatory and graded.
Primary deliverable DESIGN.md is the design document we evaluate most heavily.
Demo 5 to 10 minute Loom (or equivalent) video walkthrough is required.

On AI Tools (Read This First)
You may use AI assistants such as Copilot, Cursor, Claude, or ChatGPT freely. We use them too. What we
evaluate is your judgment, not your typing speed.
Mandatory deliverable: AI_USAGE.md
A short, honest, specific document describing how AI was used. A blank or generic file is a strong
negative signal. A thoughtful one, even if short, is a strong positive signal. This document is graded.
AI_USAGE.md must contain
1. Which AI tools you used and for what. Be specific. Examples:
◦ Cursor autocomplete for handler boilerplate.
◦ Claude to draft the initial DB schema, which I revised because [reason].
◦ ChatGPT to explain Postgres advisory locks. I ended up not using them because [reason].
2. Three decisions you made yourself, against or independent of AI suggestions. For each: what the
AI proposed (if anything), what you chose, and why.

3. One thing the AI got wrong or that you had to correct. If you genuinely had nothing to correct, say
so and explain how you verified correctness.
Problem
Build a minimal Invoice &amp; Payment Service, the kind of system that sits behind a billing product. A
business creates invoices for their customers, customers pay invoices, and the business gets notified
about state changes via webhooks.
The product surface is intentionally small. The interesting work is in the state machine, failure modes,
and data model.
Domain Model (Required Shape)
Business --has many--&gt; Customers
Business --has many--&gt; Invoices --belongs to--&gt; Customer
Invoice --has many--&gt; Payment Attempts
• A business authenticates with API keys.
• A customer belongs to one business (name plus email is enough).
• An invoice belongs to one customer, has line items, a total, a state, and a due date.
• A payment attempt records a try at paying an invoice (success, failure, or pending).
Money
• Single currency: USD.
• Integer minor units (cents). No floats anywhere in the money path. We will look for this.
Core Requirements (Must-Have)
1. API key authentication. Keys are scoped to a business. Storage, hashing, transmission, revocation:
your call. Defend it in DESIGN.md.
2. Customers. Create, get, and list customers (scoped to the authenticated business).
3. Invoices. Create with line items {description, quantity, unit_amount_cents}. The server computes
the total. Never trust a client-supplied total. Get by ID. List filterable by state. Each invoice has a
state (you define the values).
4. Payment attempts. POST /invoices/{id}/pay with a mock card token. Records a payment attempt,
calls the mock PSP, updates invoice state based on the result. Must be idempotent via
Idempotency-Key header. Must handle the PSP being slow or failing without corrupting invoice
state.
5. Invoice state machine. You define the states (typical: draft, open, paid, void, uncollectible).
Required: a state diagram in DESIGN.md showing all valid transitions, what triggers each, and
which states are terminal. Invalid transitions must be rejected at the API level with a clear error.
6. Webhooks. Businesses register endpoint URLs. They receive signed webhooks for at least
invoice.created, invoice.paid, and invoice.payment_failed. Delivery must be signed (so receivers

can verify) and retried on failure with a documented backoff. Webhook delivery must not block
the API response.
7. PostgreSQL with migrations.
8. docker compose up. Brings up app, database, and mock PSP with no further steps.
9. README. Run instructions and 3 to 4 curl examples covering: create customer, create invoice,
attempt payment (success and failure cases).
10. API documentation. OpenAPI YAML or Markdown. Include request and response shapes, and a
consistent error format.
Mock Payment Processor
We provide the spec. You build it.
Build a mock PSP service in the same repo (separate binary or a route prefix, your choice). The mock
determines outcomes from a card token string in the request:
Token Behavior
tok_success Returns {status: &quot;succeeded&quot;, psp_ref: &lt;uuid&gt;} after about 100 ms.
tok_insufficient_funds Returns {status: &quot;failed&quot;, code: &quot;insufficient_funds&quot;} after about 100

ms.

tok_card_declined Returns {status: &quot;failed&quot;, code: &quot;card_declined&quot;} after about 100

ms.

tok_timeout Sleeps 30 seconds then returns success. Your service must handle

this without hanging.

tok_network_error Returns 500 or drops the connection. Your service must handle this.
Your invoice service calls the mock PSP over HTTP. Treat it as a real external dependency. How you
handle tok_timeout and tok_network_error is a key evaluation point.
Explicitly Out of Scope
Do NOT build these.
• Subscriptions, recurring billing, plans, proration.
• Refunds or partial payments (mention them in DESIGN.md if you would add them later).
• Multi-currency or FX.
• Tax calculation.
• A frontend or UI.
• Email sending (logging “would send email” is fine).
• Production-grade rate limiting (discuss it in DESIGN.md instead).
• OAuth or any auth beyond API keys.

We value restraint
If you are tempted to build something not on the must-have list, write about it in DESIGN.md
instead of building it. What you cut, and why, is a graded section.

The Design Document (DESIGN.md)
The main deliverable.
Code can be AI-generated. Design judgment cannot. This document is the primary thing we evaluate.
Aim for roughly 800 to 1,500 words. Bullet points are fine. Diagrams welcome.
Address these sections explicitly:
1. Data Model
ER diagram or table listing. For each table: shape, indexes, primary key strategy, why this shape over
alternatives, and what you would change at 100x scale.
2. Invoice State Machine
A diagram (ASCII, Mermaid, or image) showing all states, all valid transitions, the trigger for each
transition, and which states are terminal. Then briefly: which transitions are reversible, and how invalid
transitions are rejected.
3. Payment Correctness &amp; Failure Modes
The hard section. Walk us through what happens in each case:
• (a) Two clients call POST /invoices/{id}/pay for the same invoice at the same instant. What is the
outcome? What mechanism guarantees this?
• (b) The mock PSP times out (tok_timeout, 30 s). What does your endpoint return? What state is
the invoice or payment_attempt left in? How does the caller find out the eventual result?
• (c) The PSP returns success but your service crashes before persisting that. What happens on
retry? Does the customer get charged twice?
• (d) An idempotency key is reused with a different request body. What do you do?
• (e) An invoice in paid state receives another POST /pay. What happens?
Name your concurrency mechanism (row-level lock, advisory lock, optimistic concurrency, serializable
isolation, status-conditional update, etc.) and explain why over the alternatives.
4. Webhook Design
Signing scheme (algorithm, what is signed, replay protection). Retry policy with specific numbers
(intervals, max attempts, total budget). What happens to webhooks that exhaust the retry budget? How
does a business reconcile missed events? Why is delivery decoupled from the API response path, and
how?
5. API Key Model
Generation, storage (plaintext, hash, prefix?), transmission, rotation, revocation, and blast radius if
leaked.
6. What You Cut and Why
List 3 to 5 things you deliberately did not build. This section is required.
7. Production Readiness Gap

If this shipped tomorrow, the top 3 things missing? (Observability, rate limiting, audit log, refunds,
dunning, etc.) You do not need to build them. Just demonstrate you can see them.
Testing
We do not require a coverage number. We do require:
1. One concurrency test that fires N concurrent POST /pay requests for the same invoice and asserts
that at most one succeeds, no double-charges occur, and the final state is consistent.
2. One idempotency test that retries the same request with the same key and asserts the same
response is returned without a second PSP call.
3. One PSP-failure test that uses tok_timeout or tok_network_error and asserts the invoice is not
stuck in a bad state.
Lean on these rather than testing every handler. If you skip any, explain why in the README.
Video Demo (Required)
Record a 5 to 10 minute screen recording (Loom, Zoom export, QuickTime, or any equivalent that
produces a shareable link). The video is a required deliverable.
Your video must cover, in this order:
1. Architecture overview (1 to 2 min). Walk through your services, data model, and how a request
flows from API to database to webhook delivery.
2. Live demo (2 to 3 min). Run docker compose up and demonstrate: create a customer, create an
invoice, attempt a successful payment, attempt a failing payment (use tok_card_declined), and
show the resulting webhook deliveries.
3. State machine walkthrough (1 to 2 min, unscripted). Explain your invoice state machine in your
own words. Why these states? What transitions are allowed? What is terminal? Where did you
deliberate?
4. Failure-mode walkthrough (1 to 2 min, unscripted). Pick ONE of the failure modes from
DESIGN.md section 3 and explain, on camera, exactly how your code handles it. Open the relevant
file and walk us through the lines. Use tok_timeout or tok_network_error if you want to demo
it live.
Why we ask for the video
The unscripted walkthroughs of your state machine and one failure mode are how we verify
ownership of the design. We are not looking for polish. We are looking for fluency. If you cannot
explain a decision in your own words, you did not make it.
Submission format
• Include the video link in README.md under a section titled Demo Video.
• Loom links are fine. So are Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3 links. Just make sure they are accessible
without a login.

• No editing required. Cuts, ums, and retries are fine. We want the working session, not a marketing
reel.
Submission
A GitHub repository (public or shared with us) containing:
• Source code. Invoice service plus mock PSP.
• Migrations. SQL or migration framework files.
• docker-compose.yml. One-command setup.
• README.md. Run instructions, curl examples, and demo video link.
• DESIGN.md. Per the spec above. The primary deliverable.
• AI_USAGE.md. Per the spec above. Required.
• API documentation. OpenAPI YAML or Markdown.
How We Evaluate
We grade on four axes, weighted roughly equally:
Axis What we look for
Design judgment DESIGN.md,
video walkthroughs

Specific reasoning. The state machine is coherent and complete.
Failure-mode answers are specific, not generic. You can explain
your design verbally without reading from notes.

Core correctness

Money math is integer. Concurrent payments do not double-
charge. Idempotency works. Invoice state transitions are valid. PSP
failures do not corrupt state.

Operational sense Migrations, consistent error format, sensible logging, clean docker

compose up, webhooks decoupled from request path.

Communication AI_USAGE.md,
README, commits, video

Honest, specific, shows what you contributed. Video walkthrough is
fluent and unscripted.

What does NOT score points
• Lines of code.
• Number of features beyond the must-haves.
• Exhaustive test coverage.
• Fancy abstractions.
• Premature optimization.
• Dependencies you cannot justify.
What scores strongly
A small, correct, well-explained service where the design doc and video show how you think about state,
money, and failure.
